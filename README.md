SPACE ADVENTURE GAME

To play this game, access it through the WebGL Link provided.

Controls: 
WASD – standard movement controls (Forwards, Left, Backwards, Right)
J/L – strafe left/right (this is close to wasd and can be used in conjunction with them, allowing for greater accessibility)
LShift – sprint on/off
G – turn gravity off (for 5 seconds, allowing player to jump higher and more slowly)
C – crouch
Mouse – look around 
E - check inventory (weapons player has)
Click - use weapon (provided it is equipped)
1 - Equip AR if available, 2 - Equip Shotgun if available, 3 - Equip SMG if available, 4 - Switch to Melee



Aim of the game: Collect all coins/treasure! (while navigating  all of the platforms), and then defeat and/or escape enemies as you search for the final piece of fabled, exorbitantly scarce treasure.

If a player does not collect them (coins) all they must turn around and find the ones they missed to enter the next level/complete the game, and on levels containing enemies if the player does not defeat a variable, yet always feasible amount of them, they cannot progress.

Traps - if a player hits one of these they lose a life and respawn at the beginning

NPCS - some of these slow/block the player, others cause the player to lose a life and respawn at the beginning; friendly NPCs provide useful information
		
Enemies - these patrol certain areas, and will follow the player until they are defeated or the player escapes

IF A PLAYER LOSES ALL LIVES, THEY WILL RESPAWN AT LEVEL ONE WITH EVERYTHING RESET (no matter where in the game they are).
