SPACE ADVENTURE GAME

To play this game, access it by the WebGL Link provided.

Controls: 
WASD – standard movement controls (Forwards, Left, Backwards, Right)
J/L – strafe left/right (this is close to wasd and can be used in conjunction with them, allowing for greater accessibility)
LShift – sprint on/off
G – turn gravity off (for 5 seconds, allowing player to jump higher and more slowly)
C – crouch
Mouse – look around (left, right)


Aim of the game: Collect all coins/treasure! (while navigating  all of the platforms)
If a player does not collect them all they must turn around and find the ones they missed to enter the next level/complete the game

Traps - if a player hits one of these they lose a life and respawn at the beginning
NPCS - some of these slow/block the player, others cause the player to lose a life and respawn at the beginning

IF A PLAYER LOSES ALL LIVES, THEY WILL RESPAWN AT LEVEL ONE WITH EVERYTHING RESET (no matter where in the game they are).
